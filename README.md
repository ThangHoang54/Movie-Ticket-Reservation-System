# COSC2440 Further Programming Lab Test - Movie Ticket Reservation System Application 📽️🎫

Welcome to the COSC2440 Further Programming Lab Test repository! This project serves as the Lab Test source code 
for COSC2440 Further Programming course.

## About the Project ℹ️
A movie ticket reservation plays a vital role in the efficient operation of 
the modern theaters. This project involves using __JavaFX__ to create an intuitive front-end interface
and __Java__ to develop the back-end functionality.

In addition to selling tickets at physical counters, most theaters now offer the convenience of online reservations through their websites. This system will faciliate
the online booking of movies tickets. Each user can make one or more bookings, with each booking linked to a specific movie show. The booking includes details of the seats reserved for the chosen show
